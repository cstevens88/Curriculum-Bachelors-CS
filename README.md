How to Teach Yourself Computer Science: A Self Taught B.S. level CS Curriculum

This page is a curated list of resources to teach yourself computer science (CS) at a Bachelor's degree level. 

Ideally, the resources should be free and fully interactive courses. Interactive courses are not available for every topic, so additional resources are included in the following order of preference: Interactive courses (videos, readings, graded excercises, and discussion groups) > Static courses (videos, readings, and non-graded excercises) > Readings > Videos.

Please feel free to critique the list, but avoid adding too many course options. The goal is to keep the curriculum simple and doable.
