There are tons of free online resources that will help you "Learn Programming Language X," but it's difficult to find courses that will give you a deeper understanding of computer science (CS) like what's taught in a bachelor's level CS program. There is a lot more to CS than what you get from learning a programming language or going to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/web-era-trade-schools-feeding-a-need-for-code.html?_r=0" target="_blank">webdev bootcamp</a>, so I've put together this self taught curriculum based on the most important courses you'd learn in a typical BS in CS program.

Below you'll find a compilation of resources for teaching yourself the fundamentals of computer science. The categories are based largely off of the <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/grad/prereq" target="_blank">undergraduate pre-requisites for a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Florida</a> and the<a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students/future-students/curriculum/track-options" target="_blank"> accelerated post-baccalaureate in Computer Science at Oregon State University</a> (simply because they made a nice concise list), with a few extra items based on what seems to be important to the professional CS community. The content was found all over the place, but the wonderful folks at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/" target="_blank">/r/learnprogramming</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions" target="_blank">/r/cscareerquestions</a> have been especially helpful.

The curriculum is weighted towards interactive courses, followed by static courses with materials and sample exercises, followed by full texts. I've tried to avoid lists of YouTube videos and the like because it's harder to learn from lectures. These are mostly free resources; however, I've included some books that are too useful not to mention.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Math</span>:</h3>
<em>Calculus, Statistics, Probability. Computer Science is a branch of mathematics after all.</em>

<strong><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></strong> - Tons of resources here, but the math courses in particular are convenient and accessible. Select the math you want to know (Probability and Statistics, and Calculus) and Khan Academy will test you and determine what you need to learn to get there.
