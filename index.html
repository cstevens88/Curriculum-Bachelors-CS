<p>There are tons of free online resources that will help you "Learn Programming Language X," but it's difficult to find courses that will give you a deeper understanding of computer science (CS) like what's taught in a bachelor's level CS program. There is a lot more to CS than what you get from learning languages or going to a webdev bootcamp, so this is an attempt to create self taught curriculum based on the most important courses you'd learn in a typical BS in CS program.</p>

<p>Below you'll find a compilation of resources for teaching yourself the fundamentals of computer science. The categories are based largely off of these <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/grad/prereq">undergraduate pre-requisites for a Master's in Computer Science</a>, with a few extra items based on what seems to be important to the professional CS community. The content was found all over the place, but the wonderful folks at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">/r/learnprogramming</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">/r/cscareerquestions</a> have been especially helpful.</p>

<p>The curriculum is weighted towards interactive courses, followed by static courses with materials and sample exercises, followed by full texts. I've tried to avoid lists of YouTube videos and the like because it's harder to retain information from lectures. These are mostly free resources; however, I've included some books that are too useful not to mention.</p>

<h1>
<a id="math" class="anchor" href="#math" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Math:</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> - Tons of resources here, but the math courses in particular are convenient and accessible.
